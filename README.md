## Lesson 4 10/25/2021
#### Introduction to 'Lists' and 'For Loops'
One of the most used data structure is a List. Lists allows to store an object (any data types ex. strings, integers, lists, etc). There are many ways to manipulate lists, an example is for loops. Learn how to store elements in lists and utilize for loops to manipulate lists. 

### Homework 4
 1. print all the elements in side string_list
 2. add all the elements in float_list 
 3. create a list of 10 elements consiting of both floats and strings. Then using for loop add all the elements in side the list you created.
