# intro-to-python
Hello Everyone! I teach python for beginner high schoolers. All the python code from my tutoring session is uploaded in this repo. This repo will have beginner conecepts of python and fundametals of programming. 

## Updates
The Lesson plan and code for my lesson will be updated every week on Monday nights EST. Please check back on Monday nights for updates!

## Technology Requirements and Setup 
### Replit.com
We use replit.com for our IDE. Replit.com is an online IDE that allows to work and view coding projects in real time. Students are explected to do their homework on the workspace that the teacher created for them.

### Homework 1
 1. add two numbers 

 2. minus two numbers 

 3. divide two numbers

 4. multiply two numbers 

 5. add up all the results from questions 1~4 and print out the result.

## Lesson 3 10/11/2021
+ shortcuts and different syntax for math expressions
+ boolean operators and statements

### Homework 2
##### Asume a = 3, b = 8

 1. use another expression for a = a + 1 
 2. use another expression for b = b - 2
 3. use another expression for b = b/2
 4. use another expression for a = a*2
 5. print the boolean value of "is 'a' equal to 'b'?"
 6. print the boolean value of "is 'a' not equal to 'b'?"

## Lesson 4 10/11/2021
#### Introduction to 'Lists' and 'For Loops'
One of the most used data structure is a List. Lists allows to store an object (any data types ex. strings, integers, lists, etc). There are many ways to manipulate lists, an example is for loops. Learn how to store elements in lists and utilize for loops to manipulate lists. 

### Homework 4
 1. print all the elements in side string_list
 2. add all the elements in float_list 
 3. create a list of 10 elements consiting of both floats and strings. Then using for loop add all the elements.

## Lesson 5 10/25/2021
+ Lists and For Loops in depth
+ What kind of objects can we store in lists? How to do append a list?
  + Add 
  + Update
  + Remove
  + Clear all elements in list 
+ For loop ranges

### Homework 5
##### nums_list = [1,34,7,17]
##### Animal_list=["koala", "cat", "fox", "panda", "chipmunk", "sloth", "penguin", "dolphin"]
1. Using for loops and range count down numbers from 10 ~ 2 
2. Using for loops and range print numbers from 0~ 9
3. Using for loops and range print out numbers from 1-20 but add 3 to every iteration. 
4. Using for loops add all the numbers in the nums_list
5. Write a for loop print all the elements in the list.
6. Using a for loop and .append() method append 2 more animals in the list. print the appended list 
7. Clear all the elements in the list and print the cleared list
