#Python Casting
# There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

# Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

# int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
# float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
# str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals




b = "Hello, World!" 

print(b[2:5])

print(b[4:7])

print(b[:4])

print(b[1:])


#Modify string 

a = "Hello, World!" 
print(a.upper())

print(a.lower())

print(a.strip())


# print(a.replace("H","J"))


print(a.split(","))

#While Loops

# While(condition){
#   statement

# }

a = 5 
while a == 5: 
  print("hi")
  break


a = "4.2"
b = "Modyfing strings is very easy and fun."
# 1. Convert 'a' to a float
# 2. Slice the string 'a' from 0 to 1 
# 3. Using string slicing, print out only the word 'strings' in 'b'
# 4. Split string where the "." is in 'a'. 
# 5. Split string where all the 'i' is in 'b'. 
# 6. split string where all the ' ' space is in 'b'.
# 7. Example Print i as long as i is less than 6 using while loop
